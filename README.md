# Sensor-Hub-Booster-Pack-library
This is a library i created in order to use the Texas Instruments's Sensor Hub Booster Pack with an Arduino or an ESP32. 
The Sensor Hub communicates with your microcontroller via the I2C bus. Take a look at its datasheet in order to know which pins are the SCL and the SDA. 
The Sensor Hub contains 5 sensors in its board, however i only developed code for 3, because those were the only ones i needed. Feel free to complete it!
